# JogBox-for-UCCNC
A minimal floating 'jog button' panel for UCCNC

# About
This is mostly a quick 'demo' made up of code chunks meant to be a 'how to' for creating UCCNC plugins that do jogging, etc.

This is functional, likely has some small errors.  Use as a starting point for your own UCCNC plugin :)
